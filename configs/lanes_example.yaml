# Lane geometry configuration example
# All coordinates are in pixels relative to the camera frame.
# Adjust to match your actual camera resolution and lane positions.

# Counting direction:
#   "any"      – count vehicles crossing in either direction
#   "positive" – count only when the signed cross-product changes from negative to positive
#                (roughly: downward / increasing-y crossing)
#   "negative" – count only upward / decreasing-y crossings
direction: "any"

# Lane 1 polygon – list of [x, y] points forming a closed polygon
lane1_polygon:
  - [0,   0]
  - [960, 0]
  - [960, 360]
  - [0,   360]

# Lane 2 polygon
lane2_polygon:
  - [0,   360]
  - [960, 360]
  - [960, 720]
  - [0,   720]

# Counting line – two points [[x1,y1],[x2,y2]]
# Vehicles are counted when their bottom-center crosses this line
# in the configured direction while inside a lane polygon.
